# Demo

A starter project for including [sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) end [es6](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) support.

Requirements:

* [Node 8](http://sass-lang.com/guide)


## Scripts

### npm run start

 * Starts a server with livereload and watches files in dist/ and app/
 * Starts watchers for sass and javascripts (es6) and writes to dist/

## npm run build

Builds assets, such as js & css


## Adding files

Copy this repo, do not push your prototype to this repo!

* Place sass and scripts in src/ folders. The watchers will add builds to dist folder after they are imported in the index files.
* Other static assets, like fonts and images and custom, can be added to app **(this should be changed later)**
